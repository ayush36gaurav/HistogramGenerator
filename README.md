The main code for the 1D Histogram Generator is in the file "OneD_HistogramGenerator.cpp".

The code best runs on an IDE such as VS Code wherein it prompts the use for inputs in order to take arguments.

Details about Unit Testing of the code:-
1. I have performed unit testing for all functions in the Data and Reader class.
2. The header file used in both the cases is the same named "UnitTestHeader.h".
3. Since Data class has two classes Vector and FourVector classes, I have made separate files named "Data_VectorClass_UnitTest.cpp" and "Data_FourVectorClass_UnitTest.cpp".
4. Reader class has only one function 'Readfile' within it which requires a .txt file to function. Hence, I have made a .txt file named "Reader_test.txt" to perform unit testing.
